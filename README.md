# Final Project - Computer Graphics

## https://youtu.be/gB33iy0r1cI

This is the Final Project for CS 5130 Computer Graphics and I choose the topic ray tracing. Most of my project is based on the books Ray Tracing in One Weekend and and Ray Tracing: The Next Week by Peter Shirley.

and his repo: https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io

I explained what I learned and achieved in the video and will in future try to achieve this in Unity with much faster iteration talking to GPU.
